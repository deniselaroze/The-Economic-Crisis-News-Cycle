# The-Economic-Crisis-News-Cycle

RAYMOND DUCH, DENISE LAROZE  and IÃ‘AKI SAGARZAZU


We examine the dynamics of economic attitudes and the mediated economy over the course of the 2008 Great Recession in the UK.  The UK media was quick to respond to the global shock with a large jump in the volume and negative tone of newspaper stories.  But volume and negative tone persists in spite of improvements in economic output.  At the outset of the economic crisis the public behaves similarly -- they register a particularly dramatic negative subjective evaluation of the economy.  But subjective evaluations recover quickly as economic output improves.  Over the course of the economic crisis economic attitudes more closely track the real economy than is the case of media economic coverage.  The public disengages from economic news over the crisis cycle -- in the latter years they pay less attention to economic. news and media economic coverage is more weakly correlated with subjective economic evaluations.
